# Cineam4D_Plugins
C4D Version: R16 

INSTALL: drop the Aligber floder into the cinema 4D Plugin folder.

This is my first ever Plugin for anything ever! So I am assuming there will be
bugs and some over all code that could be avoided.
This Tool is inspired by the 3dsMax default Align tool.

Usage: Select one or more object you want to align, then run the tool, now connect 
a target object and align! Gives the options of separating out Translation XYZ, 
Rotation XYZ, and Scale XYZ.
